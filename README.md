# Null Pointer Dereference Bug in C++

This repository demonstrates a common C++ error: dereferencing a null pointer. The `bug.cpp` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.cpp` provides the corrected version.  Null pointer dereferencing is a frequent cause of segmentation faults and crashes.  Always check for null pointers before dereferencing them to avoid this issue.
